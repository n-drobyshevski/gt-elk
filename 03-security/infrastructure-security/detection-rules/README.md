# Infrastructure Security Detection Rules

## Overview

This directory contains detection rules specifically designed for monitoring infrastructure security events. These rules focus on traditional IT infrastructure components including servers, networks, endpoints, and on-premises systems.

## Rule Categories

### Network Security
- Intrusion detection rules
- Network anomaly detection
- Firewall event analysis
- VPN access monitoring

### Host Security
- System access monitoring
- Process execution analysis
- File system integrity
- Registry modifications

### Access Control
- Authentication failures
- Privilege escalation attempts
- Unauthorized access patterns
- Service account abuse

### System Monitoring
- System configuration changes
- Service failures and anomalies
- Resource exhaustion indicators
- Compliance violations

## Rule Development Guidelines

### Infrastructure-Specific Context
- Rules should leverage infrastructure-specific log sources
- Consider on-premises vs. cloud infrastructure differences
- Account for legacy system integration requirements
- Focus on traditional IT security controls

### Data Sources
- Windows Event Logs
- Syslog from network devices
- IDS/IPS alerts
- Firewall logs
- Endpoint protection logs
- Active Directory events

### Thresholds and Tuning
- Rules should be tuned for infrastructure baselines
- Consider business hours and maintenance windows
- Account for legitimate administrative activities
- Minimize false positives from automated systems

## Integration with Dashboards

These detection rules integrate with dashboards located in:
- `../dashboards/alerts/` - Real-time security alerts
- `../dashboards/threats/` - Threat analysis views
- `../dashboards/compliance/` - Compliance monitoring
